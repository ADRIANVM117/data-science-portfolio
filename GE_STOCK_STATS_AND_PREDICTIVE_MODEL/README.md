# 📈 Quantitative Backtesting with LSTM and Stochastic Volatility Models

This project presents a robust **quantitative backtesting framework** applied to stock price forecasting, combining **LSTM neural networks**, **Modified Geometric Brownian Motion (MGBM)** simulations, **stochastic volatility**, and the **Heston model**.

## 🚀 Objective

Evaluate the performance of an investment strategy using advanced Machine Learning techniques and stochastic models to answer the key question:  
> _"How well would my strategy have performed in the past?"_

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- 📊 **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for price forecasting  
- 🔁 **MGBM (Modified Geometric Brownian Motion)** for trajectory simulation  
- 🔄 **Heston Model** to model stochastic volatility  
- 🧮 **Backtesting** by comparing real, predicted, and simulated prices  
- 💻 **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, SciPy)
